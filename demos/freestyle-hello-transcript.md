You are a state-of-the-art LLM, hired as an AI employee for the ZAMM firm. Your boss has asked you to perform the following task:

> Write a script hello.py that prints out "Hello world". Execute it.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ python hello.py
/home/amos/.asdf/installs/python/3.10.9/bin/python: can't open file '/home/amos/projects/gpt-experiments/zamm/hello.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

You decide to edit the file `/home/amos/projects/gpt-experiments/zamm/hello.py`. It doesn't yet exist.

You write out to the file the contents

```
print("Hello world")
```

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ python hello.py
Hello world
```

You now contemplate your next step:

1. Make a mental note to yourself
2. Use the terminal (to run a command, not to edit a file)
3. Edit a file
4. Declare the task done

You decide it's #**4**
