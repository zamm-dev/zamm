      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide

      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing

      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout

      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead

      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou

      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing

      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to

      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout

      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing

      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout

      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing

      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython

      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      .\nSuccess: no issues found in 2 source files\u001b(B\n```\n\nYou note that
      any good project requires version control. We''ll go with the most popular,
      `git`.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ git init\nInitialized

      note that let''s automate common tasks with `make`, a classic tool for managing
      your build tasks.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `Makefile`. It doesn''t yet
      exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\n.PHONY: format lint

      note that we should create a test file so that `pytest` detects and runs our
      tests successfully.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `tests/test_pytest_works.py`.
      It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\n\"\"\"Dummy

      pytest can find and execute this test.\"\"\"\n    assert 1 == 1\n```\n\nYou
      note that as usual, we check that we''ve configured `make` successfully.\n\nYou
      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead

      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou

      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou now contemplate
      your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use the terminal\n3.
      Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #", "stop": [" "]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack

      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s

      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou now contemplate
      your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use the terminal\n3.
      Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #", "stop": [" "]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ", "stop": ["\n"]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest
      = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[tool.isort]\nmulti_line_output
      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou
      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",
      "stop": [" "]}'
    headers: {}
    method: POST
    uri: tool://Human
  response: '3'
- request:
    body: '{"prompt": "You are a button presser trained to do simple tasks. Your boss
      has asked you to perform the following task:\n\n> Create a new Python project
      named hello-world\n\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      new hello-world\nCreated package hello_world in hello-world\n$ cd hello-world\n$
      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file: ", "stop": ["\n"]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest
      = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[tool.isort]\nmulti_line_output
      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      any good project requires version control. We''ll go with the most popular,

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t

      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when

      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t

      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s

      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead

      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou

      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at

      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s

      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou

      |\n          make tests\n```\n\nYou now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make
      a mental note to yourself\n2. Use the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the
      task done\n\nYou decide it''s #", "stop": [" "]}'
    headers: {}
    method: POST
    uri: tool://Human
  response: '1'
- request:
    body: '{"prompt": "You are a button presser trained to do simple tasks. Your boss
      has asked you to perform the following task:\n\n> Create a new Python project
      named hello-world\n\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      new hello-world\nCreated package hello_world in hello-world\n$ cd hello-world\n$
      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t
      yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",
      "stop": [" "]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest
      = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[tool.isort]\nmulti_line_output
      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest
      = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[tool.isort]\nmulti_line_output
      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s

      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$

      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =

      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou

      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s

      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme
      = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include = \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython
      = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack
      = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend
      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname
      = \"hello-world\"\nversion = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos
      Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme = \"README.md\"\npackages = [{include =
      \"hello_world\"}]\n\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]\npytest
      = \"^7.2.1\"\nblack = \"^23.1.0\"\nisort = \"^5.12.0\"\n\n[tool.isort]\nmulti_line_output
      = 3\ninclude_trailing_comma = true\nforce_grid_wrap = 0\nline_length = 88\nprofile
      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.2s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      .\nSuccess: no issues found in 2 source files\u001b(B\n```\n\nYou note that
      any good project requires version control. We''ll go with the most popular,
      `git`.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ git init\nInitialized

      note that let''s automate common tasks with `make`, a classic tool for managing
      your build tasks.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `Makefile`. It doesn''t yet

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou

      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black

      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion

      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group

      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re

      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when

      note that make sure no files are left behind\n\nYou now contemplate your next
      step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4.
      Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #", "stop": [" "]}'

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme

      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating

      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when

      poetry version 0.0.0\nBumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0\n```\n\nYou note that
      every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible
      default testing framework to use for Python. So let''s install `pytest` and
      make sure it''s working.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry
      add pytest --group dev\nUsing version ^7.2.1 for pytest\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.3s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or

      no tests ran in 0.01s =============================\n```\n\nYou note that this
      is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let''s now turn our attention towards
      Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape.
      `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout
      the codebase.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add black
      --group dev\nUsing version ^23.1.0 for black\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving
      dependencies... (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or
      update\n```\n\nYou note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports
      sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add isort --group dev\nUsing
      version ^5.12.0 for isort\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We''ll
      put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration
      for the project should live by default.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`.
      Its old contents were\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname = \"hello-world\"\nversion
      = \"0.0.0\"\ndescription = \"\"\nauthors = [\"Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>\"]\nreadme

      = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n\n```\n\nYou replace the file contents with\n\n```\n[tool.poetry]\nname

      = \"black\"\n\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend =
      \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n\nYou note that now, let''s setup `flake8`,
      a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that
      also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group
      dev\nUsing version ^6.0.0 for flake8\nUsing version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings\n\nUpdating
      dependencies\nResolving dependencies... (0.6s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nPackage

      (1.7.0): Installing...\n\u001b[1A\u001b[0J  \u2022 Installing flake8-docstrings
      (1.7.0)\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There
      are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we''re
      setting up a generic Python project, let''s stick to the defaults.\n\nYou decide
      to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file
      the contents\n\n```\n[flake8]\n# Match black line length (default 88) instead
      of flake8 default of 79\nmax-line-length = 88\nextend-ignore =\n    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373\n    E203,\n```\n\nYou
      note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too
      now\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ls **/__init__.py\nhello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"A brand new project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were\n\n```\n\n```\n\nYou
      replace the file contents with\n\n```\n\"\"\"All tests for the hello-world project.\"\"\"\n```\n\nYou
      note that let''s check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running
      it.\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run flake8 .\n./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27:
      W292 no newline at end of file\n./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at
      end of file\n```\n\nYou note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically
      fix linting errors, so let''s install `autoflake` for that functionality.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add autoflake --group dev\nUsing
      version ^2.0.1 for autoflake\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...
      (0.1s)\n\nWriting lock file\n\nNo dependencies to install or update\n```\n\nYou
      note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry add mypy --group dev\nUsing
      version ^1.0.1 for mypy\n\nUpdating dependencies\nResolving dependencies...

      note that let''s automate common tasks with `make`, a classic tool for managing
      your build tasks.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `Makefile`. It doesn''t yet
      exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\n.PHONY: format lint

      note that we should create a test file so that `pytest` detects and runs our
      tests successfully.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `tests/test_pytest_works.py`.
      It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\n\"\"\"Dummy

      pytest can find and execute this test.\"\"\"\n    assert 1 == 1\n```\n\nYou
      note that as usual, we check that we''ve configured `make` successfully.\n\nYou
      proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ make\npoetry run autoflake -r -i

      up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However,
      the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder''s
      name. If you''re an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user''s name from
      their Git config using the terminal:\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git config --global user.name\nAmos Jun-yeung Ng\n```\n\nYou note that the name
      being output here. For me, it is \"Amos Jun-yeung Ng\" because that is my name.
      Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when
      writing the MIT license.\n\nYou decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn''t
      yet exist.\n\nYou write out to the file the contents\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright

      set up testing. First we make note of the poetry version:\n\nYou proceed to
      use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry --version\nPoetry (version 1.3.1)\n```\n\nYou
      note that the poetry version here is 1.3.1, so that''s what we''ll use when
      creating our Github workflows. Adjust accordingly if your output differs.\n\nYou
      decide to edit the file `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. It doesn''t yet exist.\n\nYou
      write out to the file the contents\n\n```\nname: lint\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:

      note that make sure no files are left behind\n\nYou proceed to use the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$
      git status\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n```\n\nYou
      now contemplate your next step:\n\n1. Make a mental note to yourself\n2. Use
      the terminal\n3. Edit a file\n4. Declare the task done\n\nYou decide it''s #",
