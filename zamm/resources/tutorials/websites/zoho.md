## Adding email aliases

To add aliases to a custom email domain managed by Zoho, follow the instructions [here](https://www.zoho.com/mail/how-to/create-email-alias.html). You'll want to save the url, which should look something like `https://mailadmin.zoho.com/cpanel/home.do#users/123456/mailSettings/alias`, for faster access to this next time.
