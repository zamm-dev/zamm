# Setting up `ruff`

To set up `ruff` as a code linter for our project, the very first command we run is to install `black` as a dev dependency.

```bash
$ poetry add ruff --group dev
Using version ^0.0.282 for ruff

```

## Configuration

Edit `pyproject.toml` to introduce a section for `ruff`. If it currently looks like this:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "zamm"
version = "0.0.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"


[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.4.0"
black = "^23.7.0"
ruff = "^0.0.282"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

then add a section to enforce import sorting and documentation style rules:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "zamm"
version = "0.0.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"


[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.4.0"
black = "^23.7.0"
ruff = "^0.0.282"

[tool.ruff]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "D"]
ignore = ["D203", "D212"]
target-version = "py311"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

The full set of Ruff rules can be found [here](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/).

## Confirmation

Let's actually run `ruff` and check that it works.

```bash
$ poetry run ruff check .
```

Ideally it should produce no output. However, if you do see warnings such as this:

```bash
$ poetry run ruff check .
warning: `one-blank-line-before-class` (D203) and `no-blank-line-before-class` (D211) are incompatible. Ignoring `one-blank-line-before-class`.
warning: `multi-line-summary-first-line` (D212) and `multi-line-summary-second-line` (D213) are incompatible. Ignoring `multi-line-summary-second-line`.
```

then you shold edit the `ignore` section in `pyproject.toml` again to ignore whichever conflicting rule you don't prefer.

That's all! **Don't take any more steps** because the task is now done!
