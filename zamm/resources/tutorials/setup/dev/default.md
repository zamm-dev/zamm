# Setting up a default Python dev environment

You can set up a default Python dev environment on a new machine by following these steps:

- Follow the instructions at [`zsh.md`](/zamm/resources/tutorials/setup/dev/zsh.md) to set up a ZSH shell with autocomplete.
- Follow the instructions at [`git.md`](/zamm/resources/tutorials/setup/dev/git.md) to set up git locally, generate SSH keypairs, and add them to GitHub.
- Follow the instructions at [`asdf-python.md`](/zamm/resources/tutorials/setup/dev/asdf-python.md) to set up Python using asdf versioning.

That's all! **Don't take any more steps** because the task is now done!
