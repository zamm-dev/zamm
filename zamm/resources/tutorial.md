Say you want to do the following task:

> Create a new Python project named hello-world

You can do so by following these steps:



You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry new hello-world
Created package hello_world in hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ poetry version 0.0.0
Bumping version from 0.1.0 to 0.0.0
```

You note that every project should have automated testing set up, and `pytest` is a sensible default testing framework to use for Python. So let's install `pytest` and make sure it's working.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add pytest --group dev
Using version ^7.2.1 for pytest

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.3s)

Writing lock file

No dependencies to install or update
$ poetry run pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform linux -- Python 3.10.9, pytest-7.2.1, pluggy-1.0.0

plugins: anyio-3.6.2, Faker-17.0.0, asyncio-0.20.3
asyncio: mode=strict

============================ no tests ran in 0.01s =============================
```

You note that this is a success! `pytest` runs successfully. Let's now turn our attention towards Python linting practices that will keep our projects in consistently good shape. `black` is a Python code formatter that ensures a consistent coding style throughout the codebase.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add black --group dev
Using version ^23.1.0 for black

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.1s)

Writing lock file

No dependencies to install or update
```

You note that next, we should use `isort` to keep our imports sorted and minimized (as in, all unused imports removed from files).

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add isort --group dev
Using version ^5.12.0 for isort

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.1s)

Writing lock file

No dependencies to install or update
```

You note that `isort` requires some configuration to play nicely with `black`. We'll put this configuration inside `pyproject.toml`, which is where all tooling configuration for the project should live by default.

You decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`. Its old contents were

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.0.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "hello_world"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"


[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.2.1"
black = "^23.1.0"
isort = "^5.12.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

```

You replace the file contents with

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.0.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "hello_world"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"


[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.2.1"
black = "^23.1.0"
isort = "^5.12.0"

[tool.isort]
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
line_length = 88
profile = "black"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

You note that now, let's setup `flake8`, a popular Python linting tool, and `flake8-docstrings`, a `flake8` plugin that also makes sure our public functions are well-documented.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add flake8 flake8-docstrings --group dev
Using version ^6.0.0 for flake8
Using version ^1.7.0 for flake8-docstrings

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.6s)

Writing lock file

Package operations: 1 install, 0 updates, 0 removals

  • Installing flake8-docstrings (1.7.0): Pending...
[1A[0J  • Installing flake8-docstrings (1.7.0): Installing...
[1A[0J  • Installing flake8-docstrings (1.7.0)
```

You note that `flake8` does not support `pyproject.toml`. There are other libraries that patch it to support `pyproject.toml`, but since we're setting up a generic Python project, let's stick to the defaults.

You decide to edit the file `.flake8`. It doesn't yet exist.

You write out to the file the contents

```
[flake8]
# Match black line length (default 88) instead of flake8 default of 79
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore =
    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373
    E203,
```

You note that we should make sure all the `__init__.py` files have docstrings too now

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ ls **/__init__.py
hello_world/__init__.py  tests/__init__.py
```

You decide to edit the file `hello_world/__init__.py`. Its old contents were

```

```

You replace the file contents with

```
"""A brand new project."""
```

You decide to edit the file `tests/__init__.py`. Its old contents were

```

```

You replace the file contents with

```
"""All tests for the hello-world project."""
```

You note that let's check that we have configured `flake8` correctly by running it.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry run flake8 .
./hello_world/__init__.py:1:27: W292 no newline at end of file
./tests/__init__.py:1:45: W292 no newline at end of file
```

You note that `flake8` does not have the ability to automatically fix linting errors, so let's install `autoflake` for that functionality.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add autoflake --group dev
Using version ^2.0.1 for autoflake

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.1s)

Writing lock file

No dependencies to install or update
```

You note that finally, we use `mypy` to enforce typing as much as possible.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry add mypy --group dev
Using version ^1.0.1 for mypy

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.2s)

Writing lock file

No dependencies to install or update
```

You decide to edit the file `pyproject.toml`. Its old contents were

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.0.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Amos Jun-yeung Ng <me@amos.ng>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"


[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]

```

You replace the file contents with

```

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.2.1"
black = "^23.1.0"
isort = "^5.12.0"
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
autoflake = "^2.0.1"
mypy = "^1.0.1"

[tool.isort]
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
line_length = 88
profile = "black"

[tool.mypy]
ignore_missing_imports = "True"
disallow_untyped_defs = "True"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

You note that check that `mypy` is configured correctly.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ poetry run mypy .
Success: no issues found in 2 source files(B
```

You note that any good project requires version control. We'll go with the most popular, `git`.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ git init

You note that let's automate common tasks with `make`, a classic tool for managing your build tasks.

You decide to edit the file `Makefile`. It doesn't yet exist.

You write out to the file the contents

```
.PHONY: format lint test tests clean release

all: format lint test

format:
	poetry run autoflake -r -i --remove-all-unused-imports .
	poetry run black .
	poetry run isort .

	poetry run mypy . --exclude scratch
	poetry run flake8 .
	poetry run black . --check
	poetry run isort . --check

	git tag -a -m "Creating version v$$(poetry version -s)" "v$$(poetry version -s)"
	git push --follow-tags
	poetry publish --build --username $$PYPI_USERNAME --password $$PYPI_PASSWORD
```

You note that we should create a test file so that `pytest` detects and runs our tests successfully.

You decide to edit the file `tests/test_pytest_works.py`. It doesn't yet exist.

You write out to the file the contents

```
"""Dummy test file."""


def test_pytest_works() -> None:
    """Make sure pytest can find and execute this test."""
    assert 1 == 1
```

You note that as usual, we check that we've configured `make` successfully.

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ make
poetry run autoflake -r -i --remove-all-unused-imports .
poetry run black .

You note that we need to set up licensing for this repo. We can start with the MIT license by default. However, the license includes a copyright message at the top bearing the copyright-holder's name. If you're an LLM, one trick you can do is to get the user's name from their Git config using the terminal:

You proceed to use the terminal:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name
Amos Jun-yeung Ng
```

You note that the name being output here. For me, it is "Amos Jun-yeung Ng" because that is my name. Whatever the output of this command is, put it into the `LICENSE` file when writing the MIT license.

You decide to edit the file `LICENSE`. It doesn't yet exist.

You write out to the file the contents
